Trumpet

Trumpet is a simple, flexible gamification tool for Ruby on Rails.

Using Trumpet's API is as easy! Create a user:
happy_user = User.new

Now you can create point types and award them:
happy_user.find_or_create_points(:happiness_points)
happy_user.find_or_create_points(:excitement_points)

You can now give points:
happy_user.increase_points(5, :happiness_points)
happy_user.increase_points(5, :excitement_points)

Take away points:
happy_user.decrease_points(1, :happiness_points)

And check a user's points at any time:
happy_user.current_points(:happiness_points)
=> 4
happy_user.current_points(:excitement_points)
=> 5

# TODO - update the TrumpetRuleSheet declaration to whatever we will call trumpet rules
Now that you have points, you can declare levels:
happiness_rules = TrumpetRuleSheet.new
happiness_rules.declare_level(:happiness, [2, 4, 6, 8])

happy_user is currently level 2, because she has 4 happiness_points:
happy_user.current_level(:happiness)
=> returns 2

You can also declare achievements:
happiness_rules.declare_achievement(:excited_user)

Then you can award achievements and verify whether a user has an achievement:
happy_user.award_achievement(:excited_user)
happy_user.has_achievement?(:excited_user)
=> true

Forthcoming features:
Leader board functionality
Event listeners
